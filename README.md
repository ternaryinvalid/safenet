# Welcome to SAFE.NET

## About project:
* **SAFE.NET** is a project that is designed to provide a secure and reliable way to store and transfer data.
* The project is based on GoLang and uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data.
* The project is designed to be used in conjunction with the SAFE.NET client, which is a simple and easy-to-use application that allows users to store and transfer data securely.
* Users know only their own private key and public key of the recipient. The server does not store any data, only the public keys of the users.

## Getting started:

To get started with the project, you will need to install the SAFE.NET client and server on your computer.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ternaryinvalid/safenet.git
```

After that you need to install docker on your computer and run the following command:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

After that you can enjoy the project :)
